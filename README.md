## Overview

![Demo](https://s10.gifyu.com/images/Peek-2022-01-05-19-38.gif)

Concord is a Chat Group app (just like Slack) that uses Web Socket to allow users to send and receive messages instantly. If you want to access directly the chat and jump the sign up step, you can login using the following credentials:

Email: teste@teste.com
Password: 123456

**Disclaimer**: If the login is not working, probably it's because my MongoDB Database was turned off automatically dus to inactivity.
